[TICKET: Bootstrap Sequence with Dependency Graph]
[CONTEXT]
- Problem statement: Application components fail unpredictably during initialization due to race conditions between Firebase initialization and dependent modules
- Current limitations: No synchronization mechanism exists between Firebase and components; initialization order is implicit and brittle
- User impact: Frequent application breakage during development, especially after refactoring, leading to inconsistent user experience
[/CONTEXT]

[REQUIREMENTS]
- Functional: All Firebase-dependent components must initialize only after Firebase is fully available
- Technical: Implement explicit dependency graph for initialization sequence with no LocalStorage fallback
- Integration: All state must be sourced exclusively from Firebase with zero LocalStorage usage
[/REQUIREMENTS]

[IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH]
- Suggested strategy: Create bootstrap sequence module that explicitly defines dependencies between initialization steps
- Key components:
  - Create new `src/bootstrap.js` module implementing dependency-aware initialization
  - Modify `src/index.js` to use bootstrap sequence instead of direct initialization
  - Convert Firebase services to register as initialization steps
  - Refactor state management to use Firebase-only storage

- Potential challenges:
  - Circular dependencies between modules during bootstrap
  - Handling initialization failures without degrading user experience
  - Managing offline scenarios with Firebase-only state (no LocalStorage)
[/IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH]

[ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA]
- Bootstrap sequence correctly enforces initialization order based on explicit dependencies
- Application initialization fails fast with clear error messages when dependencies cannot be satisfied
- All state is stored in and retrieved from Firebase collections exclusively
- No LocalStorage API calls exist anywhere in the codebase
- Firebase initialization completes before any dependent components are rendered
- Application provides clear loading indicators during bootstrap sequence
- Bootstrap process provides detailed logging for debugging initialization failures
